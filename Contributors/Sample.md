Hi Everyone!
I am Shreya. :woman:  
I am an undergraduate student at Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India. :mortar_board:  
Check out my [github](https://github.com/shreyateeza) profile.

A year ago I too was completely new to github and felt if someone could help me so I created the Novice Paradigm to help people get started with open source :octocat: and exploring this virtual world.  

If you have any query, suggestion or an idea that you think can help this organisation, then feel free to reach me!
